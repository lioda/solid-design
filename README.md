# solid principles and code design

Change is root of _software_, if we didn't want any change we would call it _hardware_. Specific hardware should have better berformances and less bugs.

Code design rarely has impact on behavior and features of our applications. But it sure have an impact on **readibility**, **flexibility** and **sustainability**.

To get these values, SOLID principles drive us when structuring our code in functions, objects or modules, to give us:

- testability
- more cohesion
- less couplage

Remember: a developer design her code to serve herself, other developers and the project; not the machine.

## Five Principles / Five Projects

This repository contains five projects. Each one describe one of the five principles known by the acronym of SOLID:

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open / Closed Principle **TODO**
- Liskov Substitution Principle **TODO**
- Interface Segregation Principle **TODO**
- Depency Inversion **TODO**
